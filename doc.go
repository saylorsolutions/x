/*
Package x provides eXtensions to standard packages. It may also bundle in some of the nicer golang.org/x packages where it makes sense for most of the things I work on.
The package naming in this module should map intuitively to standard packages.

This might also be a good spot for the occasional eXperimental package if I think the functionality is generally useful.
I don't think it makes sense to accept PRs for this repo, but if someone else uses it, then I'm happy to accept issues reports or suggestions on GitHub.
